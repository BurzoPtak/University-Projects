This repository consists of little projects that I had in mind below I is a list with short description about every program

1)EstimatingPI.py
Program estimates PI using 2 methods (Monte Carlo and Liebniz formula) then compares it to built in value of pi

2)NumberRepresentation.py
Program converts numbers (integers and prime numbers calculated using sieve of Erathotenes) into polar coordinates (n,n) then shows them on a graph
